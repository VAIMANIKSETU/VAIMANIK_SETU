# AeroSentinel

Edge AI for Trust-Aware Autonomous Sensor Fusion Against GPS Spoofing

---

## Overview

AeroSentinel is an AI-powered navigation trust monitoring system for UAVs, autonomous vehicles, robotics platforms, and edge aerospace systems. It addresses a critical weakness in GPS-dependent autonomy: a vehicle can receive valid-looking GPS coordinates that are intentionally false.

GPS spoofing can make an autonomous system believe it is somewhere else, drifting it away from a safe route without obvious signal loss. AeroSentinel detects this behavior by comparing GPS data against onboard sensor estimates, generating a live trust score, classifying attack severity, and reducing GPS influence when navigation becomes suspicious.

When GPS becomes untrusted, the system maintains navigation using onboard sensors, Extended Kalman Filter fusion, and IMU dead reckoning. The dashboard visualizes this behavior in real time so observers can see the attack, the trust collapse, GPS rejection, and safe fused navigation.

## Trust Engine

The trust engine compares GPS-derived motion with onboard sensor estimates and fused navigation state. It converts disagreement into a trust score from `0` to `100`.

Core feature signals:

- `Distance Error`: Difference between GPS position and fused or inertial position.
- `Speed Error`: Difference between GPS speed and IMU-derived motion.
- `Altitude Error`: Difference between GPS altitude and barometer or fused altitude.
- `Heading Error`: Difference between GPS heading and inertial heading.

High agreement produces high trust. Large divergence, sudden jumps, and inconsistent velocity or heading reduce trust and increase attack severity.

| Severity | Trust Range | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| NORMAL | 90-100 | GPS is consistent with onboard sensors. |
| SUSPICIOUS | 75-89 | Minor disagreement, continue monitoring. |
| MODERATE | 60-74 | Trust is degrading, reduce GPS influence. |
| SEVERE | 30-59 | Strong spoofing or drift evidence, favor IMU fusion. |
| CRITICAL | 0-29 | GPS rejected, dead reckoning active. |

## Trust-Aware Sensor Fusion

AeroSentinel uses continuous trust-aware weighting rather than a simple accept-or-reject GPS switch.

Example during normal flight:

```text
Trust = 92
GPS Weight = 92%
IMU Weight = 8%
```

Example during spoofing:

```text
Trust = 21
GPS Weight = 21%
IMU Weight = 79%
```

This graceful degradation is safer than binary GPS rejection because the system can reduce GPS influence as evidence builds, maintain continuity during partial degradation, and avoid abrupt navigation jumps.

## Demonstration Scenario

### Normal Flight

Expected behavior:

- Trust approximately `90+`
- Severity = `NORMAL`
- GPS accepted
- GPS path and fused path remain aligned
- Aircraft follows the safe route

### Spoofed Flight

Expected behavior:

- Trust drops significantly
- Severity becomes `SEVERE` or `CRITICAL`
- GPS influence is reduced
- GPS may be rejected
- Red GPS path visibly diverges
- Blue fused path remains stable
- Aircraft continues navigation using onboard sensors

### Backend Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn torch xgboost
```

Run the current Python pipeline:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install

```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build

Create `frontend/.env` or `frontend/.env.production`:

```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
